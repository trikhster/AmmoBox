# AmmoBox

AmmoBox is a fully modular, parametric 3D model generator for ammunition storage boxes, inspired by the Gridfinity system.  
It uses PythonOCC / OCCT libraries to create stackable, interchangeable ammo boxes and grid inserts optimized for FDM 3D printing (PLA-ready, no supports required).

## Features
- Parameterized box sizes to fit within a parent container (5.8" x 11" x 7" by default)
- Modular, removable hexagonal grid inserts sized by round diameter and height
- Support-free printing with angled (trapezoidal) profiles and sacrificial adhesion tabs
- Slide-in lids to prevent ammunition spillage
- Rounded corners for easy handling
- Designed for pistol and rifle calibers (.22LR, 9mm, .45ACP, .223, .308, etc.)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Ammobox.git
   cd AmmoBox
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

You can generate different ammo boxes and inserts by running the examples in `ammobox/examples/` or importing the modules into your own scripts.

Example:

```python
from ammobox.outer_box import make_outer_box
from ammobox.grid_insert import make_grid_insert
from ammobox.slide_lid import make_slide_lid

# Generate a 9mm insert
insert = make_grid_insert(round_diameter=9.5, round_height=29)
```

(Same idea â€” plain text ready to save!)  
Just say **"generate license"** if you want it! ðŸŽ¯
